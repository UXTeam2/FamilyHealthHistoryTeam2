## Prototype

For this project, our team produced two prototypes. The High Fidelity prototype is a simple prototype intended as a full prototype of the system as developed. The Low Fidelity prototype was designed for use in the Evaluate phase, and it adds to the High Fidelity prototype several additional UI elements to be tested during that phase. For example, it adds completion icons to the Family Bios page, a barebones login page (to be more clear to Evaluate phase test users), etc.

### High Fidelity Prototype

This prototype is available in several formats:

* Screenshots
	* A set of screenshots for each page of the prototype may be found in the High Fidelity - Screenshots folder.
* Source File
	* The High Fidelity vp file can be opened and viewed using the JustInMind prototyping tool
* HTML
	* The HTML files (located in the High Fidelity -  HTML folder) can be used to view an interactive version of the site without the JustInMind tool. They require the JustInMind chrome extension to be installed, however.

### Low Fidelity Prototype
The more fully featured low fidelity prototype, used for the Evaluate phase testing, can be accessed in an interactive form [HERE](https://invis.io/PQRL2SMSK7V)
